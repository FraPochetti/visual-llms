## ✨ How to Use

### Create Images
1. Select **"Create"** mode
2. **Choose your model:**
   - **Imagen 4 (Standard)** - Default, high-quality photorealistic generation
   - **Nano Banana (Gemini)** - Alternative multimodal model
3. Type a prompt: *"A serene mountain landscape at sunset"*
4. Click **Send**
5. Wait for the model to generate the image
6. **Click Save** to add to gallery *(images are not saved automatically!)*

### Edit Images
1. Select **"Edit selected"** mode
2. Upload an image (or select from gallery)
3. **Image appears in chat** - natural conversation flow!
4. Describe the change: *"Make the sky purple and add stars"*
5. Click **Send**
6. Nano Banana maintains likenesses while editing
7. **Chain edits**: After each edit, you can continue editing the result!
   - *"Now add a sunset"*
   - *"Make it more vibrant"*
   - Each edit builds on the previous result

### Image Interaction
- **Chat images** are displayed at a comfortable size (max 448px wide)
- **Click any image** in chat to view full size in new tab
- Hover shows cursor change and slight opacity effect
- Images from gallery appear inline in chat when sent
- **Select any image for editing**: Click "Edit This" button on any image in chat
  - Switches to Edit mode automatically
  - Selected image gets blue ring highlight
  - Button shows "✓ Selected" when that image is active
  - Perfect for comparing models then editing your favorite
- **Undo edits**: Click "← Previous" button on edited images to revert
  - Goes back to the version before the edit
  - Useful if you don't like the result
  - Example: Dog → Tiger (don't like) → Click "← Previous" → Back to Dog!

### Gallery
- Click **Gallery** to view **only saved images**
- Generated/edited images **are NOT auto-saved** - you must click Save!
- **AI-generated/edited images** show a ✨ AI badge
- **User-uploaded images** have no badge (they're yours!)
- Click any image for details and metadata
- **Actions available:**
  - **Send to Chat** - Load image into the editor for further edits
  - **Open Full Size** - View image in new tab
  - **⬇️ Download Image** - Save to your computer

### Save Button Behavior
- After generating or editing, click **"Save"** to keep the image

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "API key not valid"
- Check `.env` has `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key` (no quotes)
- Restart server after adding key
- Verify key at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

### "Image generation not available"
- Imagen 4 is the default and should work out of the box
- If you get errors, verify your API key is valid
- Try switching to Nano Banana model if Imagen 4 has issues
- Image editing always uses Nano Banana (works reliably)

### Server won't start
```bash
# Kill process on port 3000
kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:3000)

# Start again
npm run dev
```

### Images not displaying
```bash
# Fix permissions
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/visualneurons
chmod -R 755 /var/visualneurons
```

### Database issues
```bash
# Regenerate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# View database
npx prisma studio
```

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Choosing the Right Model

**Imagen 4 (Default for Creation):**
- Best for: High-quality photorealistic images
- Strengths: Detailed textures, realistic lighting, professional quality
- Use when: You want the highest fidelity image generation
- Speed: Fast generation (~5-10 seconds)

**Nano Banana (Alternative for Creation + Only Option for Editing):**
- Best for: Creative variations and image editing
- Strengths: Maintains subject likeness, follows instructions well
- Use when: You want multimodal capabilities or need to edit images
- Speed: Moderate generation

### Writing Good Prompts

**For Image Generation (Imagen 4 or Nano Banana):**
- Be specific: *"A photorealistic portrait of a cat with blue eyes, studio lighting, bokeh background"*
- Include style: *"in the style of Van Gogh"* or *"minimalist modern design"*
- Specify details: lighting, mood, composition, colors
- Imagen 4 excels at: Architecture, landscapes, portraits, product photography

**For Image Editing (Nano Banana only):**
- Be clear and direct: *"Change the shirt color to red"*
- One change at a time works best
- Nano Banana excels at maintaining facial features and identity

### Example Prompts

**Creation:**
- *"A cozy coffee shop interior, warm lighting, autumn vibes, cinematic"*
- *"Futuristic city skyline at night, neon lights, cyberpunk style"*
- *"Minimalist product photo, white background, professional studio lighting"*

**Editing:**
- *"Change the background to a beach sunset"*
- *"Make the person's outfit formal business attire"*
- *"Add a smile and brighter lighting"*

## 🎯 What This App Does

**Visual Neurons** is a chat-based image creation and editing tool:

1. **Chat Interface** - Natural language conversation

**Why Local File Storage?**
- Simple, fast, no cloud dependencies
- Perfect for dev/single-box deployment
- Easy to migrate to S3 later

**Why Session Cookies?**
- No login friction for MVP
- Isolates user data
- Production-ready upgrade path to real auth

**Why Explicit Save Button?**
- Prevents gallery clutter from experiments
- User has full control
- Can iterate many times before committing

**Why Dual Model Support (Imagen 4 + Nano Banana)?**
- **Imagen 4** is specialized for high-fidelity text-to-image generation
  - Superior photorealism and detail quality
  - Faster generation times
  - Industry-leading image generation model
- **Nano Banana** excels at multimodal tasks
  - Maintains subject likeness during edits
  - Better for creative variations
  - Unified model for both generation and editing
