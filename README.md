## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "API key not valid"
- Check `.env` has `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key` (no quotes)
- Restart server after adding key
- Verify key at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

### "Image generation not available"
- Imagen 4 is the default and should work out of the box
- If you get errors, verify your API key is valid
- Try switching to Nano Banana model if Imagen 4 has issues
- Image editing always uses Nano Banana (works reliably)

### Server won't start
```bash
# Kill process on port 3000
kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:3000)

# Start again
npm run dev
```

### Images not displaying
```bash
# Fix permissions
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/visualneurons
chmod -R 755 /var/visualneurons
```

### Database issues
```bash
# Regenerate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# View database
npx prisma studio
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Notes

**Veo 3.1 Image-to-Video Setup:**
- The SDK requires `imageBytes` as a **base64-encoded string**, not a raw Buffer
- Convert with: `imageBuffer.toString('base64')`
- Pass directly to `generateVideos()` - no file upload needed:
  ```javascript
  const base64Image = imageBuffer.toString('base64');
  await ai.models.generateVideos({
    model: 'veo-3.1-generate-preview',
    prompt: 'Your prompt here',
    image: {
      imageBytes: base64Image,  // base64 string
      mimeType: 'image/png'
    }
  });
  ```
